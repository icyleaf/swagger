Swagger is low-level library which generate output compatible with [Swagger / OpenAPI Spec 3.0.1](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md),
and wrapped many friendly APIs let developer understand and use it easier.

## Installation

```yaml
dependencies:
  swagger:
    github: icyleaf/swagger
```

## Quick look

```crystal
require "swagger"

builder = Swagger::Builder.new(
  title: "App API",
  version: "1.0.0",
  description: "This is a sample api for users",
  terms: "http://yourapp.com/terms",
  contact: Swagger::Contact.new("icyleaf", "icyleaf.cn@gmail.com", "http://icyleaf.com"),
  license: Swagger::License.new("MIT", "https://github.com/icyleaf/swagger/blob/master/LICENSE"),
  authorizations: [
    Swagger::Authorization.jwt(description: "Use JWT Auth"),
  ]
)

builder.add(Swagger::Controller.new("Users", "User resources", [
  Swagger::Action.new("get", "/users", "All users"),
  Swagger::Action.new("get", "/users/{id}", "Get user by id", parameters: [
    Swagger::Parameter.new("id", "path")
  ], responses: [
    Swagger::Response.new("200", "Success response"),
    Swagger::Response.new("404", "Not found user")
  ]),
  Swagger::Action.new("post", "/users", "Create User", responses: [
    Swagger::Response.new("201", "Return user resource after created"),
    Swagger::Response.new("401", "Unauthorizated")
  ])
]))

document = builder.built
p document
```

## Structure

Structure in `src` directory:

```
.
├── xxx.cr                        # Friendly APIs
├── http                          # HTTP assets and libraries
└── objects                       # OpenAPI objects
```

## Running on web

Swagger provids a built-in web server, if you have no idea how to preview it:

###
```crystal
require "swagger"
require "swagger/http/server"

# made your document
document = builder.built

# Run web server
Swagger::HTTP::Server.run(builder.built)
```

## Integrating

Swagger has two HTTP handlers which you can integrate it to mostly Crystal framework (like kemal, amber, lucky etc):

- Swagger::HTTP::APIHandler
- Swagger::HTTP::WebHandler
